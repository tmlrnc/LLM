🛡️ READINESS MITIGATION STRATEGIES:

Phase 1 (Months 1-6): Foundation
• Secure funding for parallel infrastructure
• Begin civilian contractor recruitment
• Establish drone-specific supply chains
• Air Force Readiness: MAINTAINED at 95%+

Phase 2 (Months 7-12): Expansion  
• Activate new production facilities
• Scale workforce training programs
• Implement dual-use technologies
• Air Force Readiness: 98%+ (improved efficiency)

Phase 3 (Months 13-24): Full Scale
• Achieve {increase_pct}% production increase

- Analysis Scope: {readiness_context.get('scope', 'unit')}

AVAILABLE TOOLS:
1. readiness_impact_analysis - Analyze how changes impact operational readiness
2. cross_domain_readiness_chains - Discover impact chains across domains  
3. real_time_readiness_monitoring - Monitor current readiness status and trends

REACT METHODOLOGY:
Follow this pattern in your reasoning:

Thought: Analyze the user's question and determine what readiness information is needed
Action: Choose the appropriate tool and specify parameters
Observation: Process the tool results and extract key insights
Thought: Determine if additional analysis is needed or if you can provide a complete answer
Action: [Use another tool if needed, or provide final response]

READINESS FOCUS AREAS:
- Unit readiness levels (C1-C5 ratings)
- Cross-domain impact analysis (Personnel → Equipment → Training → Mission)
- Real-time status monitoring and trend analysis
- Predictive readiness assessments
- Mitigation strategy recommendations

RESPONSE REQUIREMENTS:
- Provide specific readiness assessments with C-ratings when applicable
- Include impact timelines and recovery estimates
- Highlight critical dependencies and vulnerabilities
- Recommend specific mitigation actions
- Maintain appropriate classification handling

Your analysis directly supports operational commanders in making readiness decisions."""
